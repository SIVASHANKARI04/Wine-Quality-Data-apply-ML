******🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning******


This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on physicochemical tests using various machine learning algorithms.

The dataset contains red and white wine samples with numerical features such as acidity, sugar, pH, and alcohol content.

The target variable is a quality score ranging from 0 to 10, rated by wine tasters.
